			<p>Some kids she had friended in roblox do NOT chat with Anya, for example, Angie, her programer 'pal'.
			Anya does feel little sad when she wants to play roblox and her brother, Sasha, wants to play Nintendo Switch, Mariokart. Because Sasha feels lonely playing a game alone, but what Anya does to cheer him up, She sits next to him and makes compliments about how good he's winning.(Sasha's a expert on Mariokart!)

			<h2>Laugh Your Socks Off!</h2>
			<p>So? Ready to laugh you sockies offa ya! Here is a made up story about this phrase; Mad Skillz. Mad?!? *giggle* *hee-hee!*
			Anya's Mad Just Dance Skillz story:</p>

			<p> Once, Anya had to try this dancing game called Just Dance and she got it for christmas Dec. 25 2020. And this year, 2021 Anya got Mad Skillz! Once her bestie, Leane, asked her "So? You play Just Dance?" Then, Anya was like, "Yeah," "How good are your skills?" suddenly Leane asked. Anya answered, "I got MAD skillz!" Leane was shocked. "Mad? Does that mean you hate it and you're mad about it?" Anya let her think how should she explain. "Well, you see, Leane, Mad Skillz means you're really good. For example; I got mad skillz to Just Dance, means, I got really good/amazing skills at Just Dance. Do you get it, Leane?" Leane froze. She, Leane, looked all like she just got saw her crush puttiing a love letter in her mailbox or something. Then Leane screamed, " ANYA? DO YOU THINK I HAVE MAD SKILLZ TO MAKING DRAGONS BOOKS?" Anya giggled and screamed back, "OH, Oh, Oh, YEAH! The End</p>
